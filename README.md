Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a multi-select component using React and TypeScript. The component allows users to input queries, fetch data from an API, and display the results in a popup content. It also supports selecting and deselecting items, keyboard navigation, loading state display, and exception handling.

Features

Popup Content Display: Fetched data is displayed in a popup content, listing character images, names, and the number of episodes each character appeared in.
Query Highlighting: The query term is highlighted in the displayed results.
Multi-Select Functionality: Users can select and deselect items from the displayed results.
Keyboard Navigation: Keyboard navigation is supported for navigating through selected items and result rows, as well as performing deletion and selection operations.
Loading State Display: A loading state is displayed while waiting for API responses.
